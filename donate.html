      <h1>IMMUNIZATION</h1>
      <br /><br />
      <p>
        While the world has all its face towards the vaccine against COVID-19,
        the unprivileged children in India are at a high risk of facing
        contracting deadly diseases as they missed their vital childhood
        vaccinations disrupted by this pandemic.
        <br /><br />
        In April 2020, 2.9 million infants missed their first dose of the
        measles vaccine due to this pandemic. Many other vaccines are there
        having a serious illness that infects and even many children die.
        <br /><br />
        About more than 5 lakhs of children under-fives die every year due to
        lack of vaccine, preventable and treatable infections such as pneumonia,
        diarrhea, and sepsis. If all children are vaccinated after birth, more
        than half of these lives could be saved. Since the declaration of
        lockdown in March, over 13.7 lakh Anganwadis shut down. As each rural
        child care center ensures that 18 children under six in their care are
        up to date with vaccinations, it affected 2.43 crore children's in the
        first year of their lives and almost all Anganwadis remain closed.
        <br /><br />
        The longer immunization is delayed for a child, the more prone they
        become to these deadly diseases including Polio, Diptheria, Tetanus, and
        many more.
        <br /><br />
        ​ "It is not only dangerous for our children but for the health of the
        whole country, already under siege with the Coronavirus"
        <br /><br />
        ​ According to WHO Director, "while the world strives to develop a new
        vaccine for COVID-19 at record speed, we must not risk losing the fight
        to protect everyone, everywhere, against vaccine-preventable diseases."
        <br /><br />
        ​ These diseases will come roaring back if we do not vaccinate.
        <br /><br />
        ​ With such an initiative, we aim to provide all missed vaccination to
        more than 1000+ unprivileged children. Our main goal is to focus that
        each and every unprivileged child get vaccinated for preventable
        diseases such as Polio, Measles, mump, rubella, BCG, RV. At 2,000/- per
        child we will provide a cycle of vaccine and will provide a complete
        2-year schedule of the vaccine.

      <h1>COVID-19 RELIEF FUND</h1>
      <br />
      <p>
        With most urban areas still on a lockdown and businesses resuming
        operations slowly, multiple backward communities are yet to find a
        stable means to provide nutritious food and other necessities for their
        families. Many Migrant laborers have been forced to move back to their
        hometown while a large number of Daily Wage Worker continue to live in
        their Home town with no job in hand. To help them Starlight Foundation
        came forward and started its new project under Its Humanitarian Relief
        Program. Under this Covid-19 Relief Fund, you can pay to help such
        Families facing Corona Crisis.

      <p>
        India is home to more than 1.77 million homeless peoples. Chhattisgarh
        state alone accommodates 2500+ homeless peoples. Around 4500+ died
        during 2008 to 2019 allover India due to COLD WAVES. With some Districts
        of C.G having less than 5° in winters.Keeping in mind these statistics
        and the severity of the issue. We here at STARLIGHT FOUNDATION came
        forward with Project RAKSHA. In which we aim to help the homeless &
        needy by providing them with basics to combat extreme cold waves we are
        targeting to reach as many people as possible.
